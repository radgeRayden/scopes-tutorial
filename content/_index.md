# Introduction

## What's Scopes anyway?

## Who is this guide for?

You're expected to already understand the basics of programming in general, and some 
systems programming concepts like memory management and how to properly use a toolchain.
Some amount of C (or equivalent) programming experience would be best.

It would also be helpful (but not necessary) to be familiar with the languages Scopes borrows
from. If you already know some Rust, Scheme or Lua you may have a headstart in understanding 
how certain things work, or why they are that way. If you don't, don't worry!

## What it's NOT about

I do not mean to teach you how to program. I leave it to you to best choose the methods
and approaches that suit the problem at hand - use your best judgement.
What I present here are the tools Scopes puts at your disposal and how they work.

In fact, Scopes is all about _programming by your rules_. It does not strongly 
enforce paradigms, and as a community we prefer not to shame people for doing things their
own way.
While some design decisions nudge you in certain directions, the intention is that the user
may shape it into whatever they need.
