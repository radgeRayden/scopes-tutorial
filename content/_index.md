# Introduction

This is a book about the [Scopes](http://scopes.rocks) programming language. On May of 2019 I found out about it and started using it for my main projects, like games and other interactive or graphical applications. Back then the documentation was sparser, and because it is so new most of my learning consisted of experimenting, reading the source and throwing many questions at the author over IRC. Today I'm proud of having contributed to the language on multiple occasions, be it through code or reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements.

I'm writing this so newcomers can have a gentler, gradual introduction to Scopes. You can think of the text as an alternative or companion to the official docs - a more linear experience that takes you on a journey through what the language has to offer, and addresses the most common pitfalls or misconceptions I've seen from beginners.

Sometimes information here will overlap with the official documentation. This is in hopes that an additional perspective will help make things click. More often than not, though, you'll get a more conceptual explanation that is not fit for a reference.

## Before we start

This is not a tutorial for someone completely new to programming. While I make an effort to be 
as clear as possible, it would simply be out of scope to explain concepts such as algorithms, 
the stack or what is a pointer. It would be best if you have some minimal experience with another systems programming language.

It would also be helpful (but not necessary) to be familiar with the languages Scopes borrows 
from. If you already know some Rust, Scheme or Lua you may have a headstart in understanding
how certain things work, or why they are that way. If you don't, don't worry!

If you haven't already, grab a copy of the runtime or build it from source as explained [here](https://scopes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/).

With that out of the way, let's begin.
